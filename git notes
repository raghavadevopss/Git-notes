										GIT COMMANDS & Questionare
										
==============================================================================================================================

What is Git and why is it used?
Git is the most popular, open-source, widely used, and an example of distributed version control system (DVCS) used for handling the development of small and large projects in a more efficient and neat manner.

It is most suitable when there are multiple people working on projects as a team and is used for tracking the project changes and efficiently supports the collaboration of the development process.

With the help of the versioning system, the developer can identify who has made what changes and then run tests and fix bugs if any and then do necessary feature implementation. In case of any unforeseen circumstances, the code can be reverted to any of the previously working versions thereby saving huge efforts.

1. What is a version control system (VCS)?

A VCS keeps track of the contributions of the developers working as a team on the projects. They maintain the history of code changes done and with project evolution, it gives an upper hand to the developers to introduce new code, fixes bugs, and run tests with confidence that their previously working copy could be restored at any moment in case things go wrong.

2. What is a git repository?

A repository is a file structure where git stores all the project-based files. Git can either stores the files on the local or the remote repository.

3. What does git clone do?
The command creates a copy (or clone) of an existing git repository. Generally, it is used to get a copy of the remote repository to the local repository.

4. What does the command git config do?
The git config command is a convenient way to set configuration options for defining the behavior of the repository, user information and preferences, git installation-based configurations, and many such things. 

For example:
To set up your name and email address before using git commands, we can run the below commands:

git config --global
user.name
“<<your_name>>”
 
git config --global user.email “<<your_email>>”

5. What is a conflict?
Git usually handles feature merges automatically but sometimes while working in a team environment, there might be cases of conflicts such as:

1. When two separate branches have changes to the same line in a file
2. A file is deleted in one branch but has been modified in the other.
 
These conflicts have to be solved manually after discussion with the team as git will not be able to predict what and whose changes have to be given precedence.

6.Differentiate between git pull and git fetch.

git pull 	git fetch
Git pull :This command pulls new changes from the currently working branch located in the remote central repository.	
Git fetch: This command is also used for a similar purpose but it follows a two step process: 
1. Pulls all commits and changes from desired branch and stores them in a new branch of the local repository. 
current
2. For changes to be reflected in the current / target branch, git fetch should be followed by git merge command.
git pull = git fetch + git merge

7. What is Git?
I will suggest you attempt this question by first telling about the architecture of git as shown in the below diagram just try to explain the diagram by saying:

Git is a Distributed Version Control system(DVCS). It lets you track changes made to a file and allows you to revert back to any particular change that you wish.

It is a distributed architecture that provides many advantages over other Version Control Systems (VCS) like SVN. One of the major advantages is that it does not rely on a central server to store all the versions of a project’s files.

Instead, every developer “clones” a copy of a repository I have shown in the diagram with “Local repository” and has the full history of the project available on his hard drive. So when there is a server outage all you need to do to recover is one of your teammate’s local Git repository.

There is a central cloud repository where developers can commit changes and share them with other teammates.

8. What is a distributed VCS?
These are the systems that don’t rely on a central server to store a project file and all its versions.

In Distributed VCS, every contributor can get a local copy or “clone” of the main repository.

As you can see in the above diagram, every programmer can maintain a local repository which is actually the copy or clone of the central repository which is present on their hard drive. They can commit and update their local repository without any hassles.

9. What is the difference between Git and Github?
Git is a version control system of distributed nature that is used to track changes in source code during software development. It aids in coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. The main objectives of Git are speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.

GitHub is a Git repository hosting service, plus it adds many of its own features. GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface. It also provides access control and several collaboration features, basic task management tools for every project.

10. What are the benefits of using Version Control System?
With the Version Control System(VCS), all the team members are allowed to work freely on any file at any time. VCS gives you the flexibility to merge all the changes into a common version.

All the previous versions and variants are neatly packed up inside the VCS. You can request any version at any time as per your requirement and you’ll have a snapshot of the complete project right at hand.

Whenever you save a new version of your project, your VCS requires you to provide a short description of the changes that you have made. Additionally, you can see what changes are made in the file’s content. This helps you to know what changes have been made in the project and by whom.

A distributed VCS like Git allows all the team members to have a complete history of the project so if there is a breakdown in the central server you can use any of your teammate’s local Git repository.

11. What language is used in Git?
Instead of just telling the name of the language, you need to tell the reason for using it as well. I will suggest you to answer this by saying:

Git uses ‘C’ language. GIT is fast, and ‘C’ language makes this possible by reducing the overhead of run times associated with high-level languages.

12. Mention the various Git repository hosting functions.
Github
Gitlab
Bitbucket
SourceForge
GitEnterprise

13. What is a commit message?
The command that is used to write a commit message is “git commit -a”.
Now explain about -a flag by saying -a on the command line instructs git to commit the new content of all tracked files that have been modified. Also, mention you can use “git add <file>” before git commit -a if new files need to be commmited for the first time.

With an operation called “pull”, they can update their local repositories with new data from the central server and “pull” operation affects changes to the main repository from their local repository.

14. What is a repository in Git?
Repository in Git is a place where Git stores all the files. Git can store the files either on the local repository or on the remote repository.

15. How can you create a repository in Git?
This is probably the most frequently asked question and the answer to this is really simple.

To create a repository, create a directory for the project if it does not exist, then run the command “git init”. By running this command .git directory will be created in the project directory.

16. What is ‘bare repository’ in Git?
A “bare” repository in Git contains information about the version control and no working files (no tree) and it doesn’t contain the special .git sub-directory. Instead, it contains all the contents of the .git sub-directory directly in the main directory itself, whereas the working directory consists of :

A .git subdirectory with all the Git related revision history of your repository.
A working tree, or checked out copies of your project files.
